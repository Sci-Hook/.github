👋 Welcome to Sci-Hook's official GitHub page. Sci-Hook Organization strives to keep science free, to develop open-source projects, and to bring science to everyone. You can use the codes on this page in various ways for your work. We've adjusted our GitHub page to make it more convenient for developers to use. Let's start!

# Open-Source

💚 At Sci-Hook, we strive to make our projects open-source. We value and embrace open-source. For this reason, we share all of our open-source projects as open -ource without any commercial or profit motive. We usually use our GitHub page to do this. You can freely use all the projects we share as open-source, provided that you adhere to the license and usage rules.

Sci-Hook itself is not entirely open-source. It is not possible for us to do this because this could create security vulnerabilities. However, certain parts of Sci-Hook are open-source rather than the entire system. We will continue to share our newly developed systems as open-source as long as we do not mind sharing them.

# Report Bugs and Vulnerabilities

🪲 We have a special system for you to report errors and vulnerabilities in Sci-Hook systems. Please only use this system. Do not try to send them to us on GitHub. We use our own system to track requests more regularly and not to share critical vulnerabilities publicly. For information on how to report bugs and vulnerabilities and get started with reporting, check out the [Sci-Hook Bug Hunter Program](http://bughunter.scihook.org "Sci-Hook Bug Hunter Program").

# Frequently Asked Questions

❓ We've created a separate [markdown file](https://github.com/Sci-Hook/.github/blob/main/faq.md) so you can view frequently asked questions in one place. In this markdown file, you can see frequently asked questions by category and search for answers to your question. If you can't find the answer to your question on this page, you can share your question with the community and developers on the [Sci-Hook GitHub Developer Forum](https://github.com/orgs/Sci-Hook/discussions "Sci-Hook GitHub Developer Forum"). Our development team or community developers will respond to your questions.

# Developer Forum

🌐 We have a community where developers can help each other, ask questions about Sci-Hook systems, and answer questions from other developers. For information about this forum, you can [check here](https://github.com/Sci-Hook/developer-forum "check here").
